# multiplefind README

this is vscode extension multiplefind. As I was programming in vscode I've realised that we cannot higlight different words other than using ctrl + f (maybe I couldn't find it).
So I've made a simple vscode extension to find the highlighted text in the document and highlight same words in the documents.
This vscode extension supports upto 5 different colors.
I've just hard coded it, because that's all I need.

## Features

Find selected text and highlight throughout the selected document.
Supports up to 5 colors.

## Requirements

selecion of the text
ctrl + shift + 1 ~ 5
cmd + shift + 1 ~ 5

### 1.0.0

Initial release of multiplefind
